# Container-Terminal-Simulation-using-SimPy
This repository contains a simulation of a container terminal using SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework in Python. The simulation models the arrival of vessels at the terminal, berthing operations, quay crane movements, and truck transportation of containers.
